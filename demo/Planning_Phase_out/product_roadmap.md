# Product Roadmap

## Feature Idea
We will develop a microservice API that utilizes the BlackRock Aladdin platform to consume the XYZ Analysis API for analyzing customer portfolios and suggesting improvements. The API will call the BlackRock Aladdin API, which will process the portfolio details and positions, and the response will be formatted for display in the user interface for financial advisers. This will enable financial advisers to make informed business portfolio decisions for their clients.
