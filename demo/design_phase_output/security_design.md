# Security Design

Here is the comprehensive security design for the EDJ BlackRock Aladdin Benchmark Analysis Microservice API:

## Feature Overview

The EDJ BlackRock Aladdin Benchmark Analysis Microservice API integrates with the BlackRock Aladdin platform to analyze customer portfolios and provide benchmark analysis and optimization recommendations. The API ingests portfolio details and positions, leverages Aladdin's analytical tools, and returns adviser-friendly insights. Key security considerations include protecting sensitive financial data, ensuring secure integration with Aladdin, and compliance with industry regulations.

## Risk Assessment

Potential security risks and vulnerabilities include:

- Unauthorized access to the API and sensitive portfolio data
- Data breaches during transmission between EDJ and BlackRock systems
- Insider threats from EDJ employees misusing access privileges
- Injection attacks through API input parameters
- Insufficient logging and monitoring of API activities
- Non-compliance with financial industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, SEC)

## Security Measures

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Implement OAuth 2.0** for secure API authentication.
- **Use role-based access control (RBAC)** to enforce the principle of least privilege.
- **Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all API access.

### Encryption

- **Use TLS 1.2+** for encrypting data in transit between EDJ and BlackRock.
- **Implement AES-256 encryption** for sensitive data at rest in EDJ systems.
- **Use secure key management practices** for storing and rotating encryption keys.

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Validate and sanitize all API input parameters** to prevent injection attacks.
- **Implement strict data type checks**, length limits, and character restrictions.
- **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements** to avoid SQL injection.

### Access Control

- **Enforce granular access controls** based on user roles and permissions.
- **Implement IP whitelisting** to restrict API access to authorized systems.
- **Use short-lived access tokens** and regularly rotate API credentials.

### Secure Communication

- **Use secure communication protocols** (HTTPS, SSL/TLS) for all API traffic.
- **Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication** for system-to-system communication.
- **Regularly patch and update all systems** to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Implement comprehensive logging** of all API requests and activities.
- **Monitor logs in real-time** for suspicious activities or anomalies.
- **Use security information and event management (SIEM) tools** for log aggregation and analysis.

### Error Handling and Reporting

- **Implement generic error messages** that do not expose sensitive system details.
- **Use unique error codes** that can be cross-referenced internally for troubleshooting.
- **Establish secure channels** for reporting security incidents to relevant teams.

## Integration Considerations

### Integration with Existing Security Infrastructure

- **Ensure compatibility** with EDJ's existing identity and access management (IAM) systems.
- **Integrate with current security monitoring** and incident response workflows.
- **Update security policies** to include specific guidelines for the Aladdin API integration.

## Maintenance Plan

### Ongoing Security Maintenance

- **Conduct quarterly security audits** and penetration testing of the API and infrastructure.
- **Perform regular vulnerability scans** and promptly patch identified issues.
- **Monitor for new threats** and update security controls accordingly.
- **Provide ongoing security training** to development and operations teams.

## Compliance

### Compliance with Financial Industry Regulations

- **Ensure the API meets all relevant requirements** of GDPR, SEC, and other applicable regulations.
- **Maintain detailed audit logs and documentation** for compliance reporting.
- **Regularly review and update privacy policies** and data handling procedures.
- **Conduct annual compliance audits** and address any identified gaps.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Implement a bug bounty program** to proactively identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Use secure coding practices** and conduct regular code reviews.
- **Consider implementing a web application firewall (WAF)** for an additional layer of protection.
- **Establish a formal incident response plan** and regularly conduct tabletop exercises.
- **Implement data loss prevention (DLP) controls** to monitor and prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.

This comprehensive security design addresses the identified risks and provides a multi-layered approach to securing the EDJ BlackRock Aladdin Benchmark Analysis Microservice API. By implementing these measures, EDJ can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive portfolio data while maintaining compliance with industry regulations.
