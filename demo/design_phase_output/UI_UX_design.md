# User Interface Design

Here is the UI/UX design document for the feature as requested:

## Research and Analysis

Based on the research and analysis conducted, the key findings are:

- The target user group for this feature is financial advisers at EDJ who manage client portfolios. Their primary needs are to efficiently analyze portfolios, identify areas for improvement, and provide data-driven optimization recommendations to clients.
- Existing applications in the market, such as those offered by competitors like Charles Schwab and Fidelity, provide portfolio analysis tools. However, they often lack the depth of insights and seamless integration with a powerful platform like BlackRock Aladdin. There is an opportunity to differentiate EDJ's offering by leveraging Aladdin's capabilities.
- Key user goals include gaining a comprehensive understanding of portfolio performance, risk exposure, and potential for optimization. The interface should present this information in a clear, actionable format that empowers advisers in client conversations.
- Critical user tasks will be inputting client portfolio data, generating benchmark analysis, reviewing key insights and recommendations, and exporting reports for sharing with clients. The user flow should streamline these tasks.

## User Flow

1. User logs into the EDJ adviser portal and navigates to the portfolio analysis section.
2. User selects a client portfolio to analyze or inputs the portfolio details and positions.
3. User submits the portfolio for analysis, triggering a request to the BlackRock Aladdin Benchmark Analysis API via the EDJ microservice.
4. The microservice returns the analysis results, which are displayed on the portfolio analysis dashboard.
5. User reviews the key performance metrics, risk exposures, and optimization recommendations presented visually through charts and tables.
6. User explores the potential impact of optimization actions using interactive sliders and inputs.
7. User generates a PDF report of the analysis insights to share with the client.
8. User logs out of the system.

## Information Architecture

The information architecture for the feature will be organized into the following main sections:

- **Portfolio Selection**: Enables users to choose an existing client portfolio or input portfolio details.
- **Analysis Dashboard**: Displays key performance metrics, benchmarks, risk exposures, and recommendations. Organized into subsections:
  - **Overview**: High-level summary of the portfolio analysis.
  - **Performance**: Detailed breakdown of portfolio performance against benchmarks.
  - **Risk**: Identification of risk exposures and areas for concern.
  - **Optimization**: Specific recommendations for optimizing the portfolio allocation.
  - **Scenario Modeling**: Interactive tools for users to simulate the impact of optimization actions.
- **Reporting**: Functionality to generate and export client-ready PDF reports of the analysis.

## Design Considerations

Key design considerations and decisions for the feature include:

- **Balancing Simplicity and Depth of Information**:
  - Presenting a high-level overview while allowing users to drill down into more granular details.
  - Using progressive disclosure techniques to avoid overwhelming users with too much information upfront.

- **Designing for Data-Heavy Content**:
  - Utilizing clear data visualizations to make complex information more accessible and actionable.
  - Providing tooltips and context-sensitive help to aid understanding.

- **Enabling User Control and Flexibility**:
  - Allowing users to customize the analysis parameters and generate tailored insights.
  - Providing interactive tools for users to model different scenarios and see the impact of their decisions.

- **Ensuring Accessibility**:
  - Following WCAG guidelines to ensure the interface is usable by people with diverse abilities.
  - Providing alternative text for images and proper labeling for form controls.

- **Optimizing for Performance**:
  - Minimizing load times and ensuring smooth interactions, even with large datasets.
  - Implementing lazy loading and pagination techniques where appropriate.

- **Planning for Scalability and Future Enhancements**:
  - Designing a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new features and integrations.
