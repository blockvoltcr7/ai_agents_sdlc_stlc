- **Achievable:** Engage with third-party security firms and use automated security tools.
- **Relevant:** Identifies and addresses potential security weaknesses, ensuring ongoing protection.
- **Time-bound:** Implement the first audit and testing cycle within six months post-launch.

**Business Value:** High, as it continuously improves the security posture of the API, protecting against evolving threats.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Description:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and ensure that financial advisers have access only to the data and functions necessary for their role.

**SMART Criteria:**
- **Specific:** Define roles and assign permissions based on user responsibilities.
- **Measurable:** Implement RBAC for 100% of users.
- **Achievable:** Utilize existing RBAC frameworks and integrate with user management systems.
- **Relevant:** Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data misuse.
- **Time-bound:** Implement within the first three months of development.

**Business Value:** High, as it ensures that users have the appropriate level of access, reducing the risk of insider threats and data breaches.
