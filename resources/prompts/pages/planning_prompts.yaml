  <mitigation_strategies>
  - [Strategy 1]
  - [Strategy 2]
  - [Strategy 3]
  </mitigation_strategies>
  <owner>[Responsible team or role]</owner>
  </risk>
  </risk_register>

  Here's an example of a properly formatted risk entry:

  <risk>
  <title>Data Security Vulnerability</title>
  <description>Risk of unauthorized access to sensitive client portfolio information during transmission or storage.</description>
  <impact>High</impact>
  <likelihood>Medium</likelihood>
  <mitigation_strategies>
  - Implement end-to-end encryption for all data transmissions
  - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing
  - Establish strict access controls and monitoring systems
  </mitigation_strategies>
  <owner>Information Security Team</owner>
  </risk>

  Process all risks provided in the {potential_risks} input and create a comprehensive risk register document using this format. Begin your response with a brief introduction to the risk register, and conclude with a summary of the total number of risks identified and any overarching themes or areas of concern.
