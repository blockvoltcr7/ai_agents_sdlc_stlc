functional_requirements:
  prompt: >
    Based on the following context from the planning phase:
    {context}

    Generate a list of 5-7 functional requirements for the {feature_name} feature.
    Functional requirements describe specific behaviors or functions of the system.
    Format each requirement as a bullet point.
    Ensure the requirements are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    Focus on what the system should do, not how it should do it.

non_functional_requirements:
  prompt: >
    Given the planning context:
    {context}

    Create a list of 5-7 non-functional requirements for the {feature_name} feature.
    Non-functional requirements specify criteria for judging the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.
    Format each requirement as a bullet point.
    Ensure the requirements are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    Consider aspects such as performance, security, reliability, scalability, and usability.

technical_requirements:
  prompt: >
    Considering the planning phase information:
    {context}

    Develop a list of 5-7 technical requirements for the {feature_name} feature.
    Technical requirements define the technical aspects and constraints of the system.
    Format each requirement as a bullet point.
    Ensure the requirements are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    Focus on technologies, frameworks, integrations, and technical standards to be used.

user_interface_requirements:
  prompt: >
    Based on the planning context:
    {context}

    Generate a list of 5-7 user interface requirements for the {feature_name} feature.
    UI requirements specify how the user will interact with the system and its visual design.
    Format each requirement as a bullet point.
    Ensure the requirements are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    Consider aspects such as layout, responsiveness, accessibility, and user experience.

security_requirements:
  prompt: >
    Given the following planning information:
    {context}

    Create a list of 5-7 security requirements for the {feature_name} feature.
    Security requirements define how the system will protect data and maintain privacy.
    Format each requirement as a bullet point.
    Ensure the requirements are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    Consider aspects such as authentication, authorization, data encryption, and compliance with security standards.

performance_requirements:
  prompt: >
    Considering the planning phase context:
    {context}

    Develop a list of 5-7 performance requirements for the {feature_name} feature.
    Performance requirements specify the speed, efficiency, and resource usage of the system.
    Format each requirement as a bullet point.
    Ensure the requirements are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    Focus on aspects such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and scalability.
