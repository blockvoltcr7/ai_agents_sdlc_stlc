idea: >
  A microservice API that uses the BlackRock Aladdin to consume the benchmark analysis API to analyze customer portfolios
  and suggest improvements. The API must be created by the company named "EDJ".
  It calls the BlackRock Aladdin API, which consumes the portfolio details and positions.
  The response should be formatted for display in the user interface for financial advisers to use in making business portfolio decisions for their clients' portfolios.
