1. **AI-Assisted Requirement Refinement**:
   - Implement an AI-powered suggestion system that can analyze the generated requirements and propose improvements, clarifications, or identify potential gaps.
   - Use natural language processing to ensure requirements are clear, concise, and follow best practices (e.g., SMART criteria).

2. **Stakeholder Collaboration Features**:
   - Add a commenting system that allows stakeholders to provide feedback on specific requirements directly within the Streamlit app.
   - Implement a voting or priority-setting mechanism for stakeholders to indicate the importance of each requirement.

3. **Real-time Estimation and Feasibility Analysis**:
   - Integrate an AI model that can provide rough estimates of development time and complexity for each requirement.
   - Include a feasibility checker that flags potentially challenging or high-risk requirements based on the project context.

4. **Interactive Requirement Visualization**:
   - In addition to generating static diagrams, implement interactive visualizations that allow users to drag and drop elements, adjusting relationships in real-time.
   - Use tools like Plotly or Bokeh for creating interactive charts and graphs to visualize requirement dependencies and priorities.

5. **Version Control and Change Tracking**:
   - Implement a simple version control system within the app to track changes to requirements over time.
   - Provide a diff view to easily see how requirements have evolved throughout the analysis phase.

6. **AI-Driven Test Case Generation**:
   - Based on the finalized requirements, use AI to generate initial test cases or user stories that can be used in the testing phase.

7. **Compliance and Regulatory Checker**:
   - Implement an AI-powered system that checks requirements against relevant industry standards or regulations (e.g., GDPR for data privacy, WCAG for accessibility).

8. **Integration with Project Management Tools**:
   - Add options to export requirements directly to project management tools like Jira or Trello, creating epics or user stories automatically.

9. **Contextual Learning and Improvement**:
   - Implement a feedback loop where the AI model learns from user edits and refinements, improving its ability to generate high-quality requirements over time.

10. **Multi-language Support**:
    - Add capabilities to generate requirements in multiple languages, ensuring global teams can easily understand and work with the documentation.

11. **Risk Assessment Matrix**:
    - Automatically generate a risk assessment matrix based on the requirements, highlighting potential areas of concern for the project.

These enhancements build upon your excellent draft, adding more AI-assisted features, collaboration tools, and integration options. The focus is on making the requirements analysis process more interactive, data-driven, and aligned with modern software development practices. This approach should create a robust bridge between the Planning and Design phases, ensuring all stakeholders have a clear, shared understanding of the project requirements.
