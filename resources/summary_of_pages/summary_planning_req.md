Based on the analysis of the planning and requirements pages, here's a summary of what has been completed:

1. Planning Phase (02_Planning.py):
   - Allows users to input details about a new feature idea
   - Generates various planning documents using AI, including:
     - Feature proposal
     - Market analysis
     - Business case
     - Project charter
     - Product roadmap
     - Stakeholder analysis
     - Risk register
     - Resource estimation
   - Provides options to generate all sections sequentially or individually
   - Allows users to review, regenerate, and finalize planning documents
   - Includes model selection and parameter tuning for AI-generated content

2. Requirements Analysis Phase (03_Requirements_Analysis.py):
   - Displays a summary of the planning phase documents
   - Generates detailed requirements for the new feature, including:
     - Functional requirements
     - Non-functional requirements
     - Technical requirements
     - User interface requirements
     - Security requirements
     - Performance requirements
   - Allows users to review, regenerate, and finalize requirements
   - Tracks progress of requirements generation
   - Includes model selection and parameter tuning for AI-generated content

As an expert SDLC professional, for the design phase, I suggest including the following elements to ensure a high-quality experience and deliver comprehensive design specifications:

1. Design Overview:
   - Brief introduction to the design phase
   - Summary of key inputs from planning and requirements phases

2. System Architecture Design:
   - High-level architecture diagram
   - Component descriptions
   - Integration points with existing systems

3. Database Design:
   - Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
   - Data dictionary
   - Database schema

4. User Interface Design:
   - Wireframes for key screens
   - User flow diagrams
   - UI style guide

5. API Design:
   - API endpoints documentation
   - Request/response formats
   - Authentication and authorization methods

6. Sequence Diagrams:
   - Key user interactions
   - System processes
   - Data flow between components

7. Security Design:
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Data encryption methods
   - Security controls and best practices

8. Performance Considerations:
   - Scalability design
   - Caching strategies
   - Performance optimization techniques

9. Testing Strategy:
   - Test plan outline
   - Test cases for critical components

10. Design Review and Approval:
    - Stakeholder feedback mechanism
    - Design validation checklist
    - Approval workflow

11. Documentation:
    - Design document template
    - Version control for design artifacts
    - Traceability matrix (linking requirements to design elements)

12. AI-Assisted Design Generation:
    - Integration with AI models for generating initial design drafts
    - Options to refine and customize AI-generated designs

13. Collaboration Tools:
    - Comments and feedback system
    - Real-time collaboration features

14. Export and Sharing:
    - Options to export design documents in various formats
    - Sharing capabilities with stakeholders

To implement this structure, consider creating expandable sections for each major design component, allowing users to focus on specific areas. Integrate AI-assisted generation for initial drafts of diagrams and descriptions, with options for human refinement. Ensure that the design phase clearly references and builds upon the outputs from the planning and requirements phases, maintaining traceability throughout the SDLC.

You are correct that the design phase is where we create architecture designs, flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams. These visual representations are crucial for communicating the system's structure and behavior to all stakeholders.
